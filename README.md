# Chicago Nursing Home Search
This website is no longer actively maintained. We're leaving it online so you can see how it worked, but we recommend you use Medicare's search instead.

Chicago Nursing Home Search was a tool for people to research nursing homes in the Chicagoland area using
[nursing home provider info from Medicare](https://data.medicare.gov/Nursing-Home-Compare/Provider-Info/4pq5-n9py).
